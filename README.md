[Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)
(Regexes, for short) are patterns used to match character combinations in
strings. [`grep`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) is a CLI tool for
searching using Regexes.

The entry point for your `grep` implementation is in `app/main.py`. Study and
uncomment the relevant code, and push your changes to pass the first stage:

```sh
git commit -am "pass 1st stage" # any msg
git push origin master
```

Time to move on to the next stage!

1. Ensure you have `python (3.11)` installed locally
1. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `app/main.py`.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.
